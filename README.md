# PHP Jet Framework

PHP Jet is a powerful **PHP8** framework. Of course, it includes **MVC architecture**, **ORM**, **modularity**, **REST API server** and so on, but above all, it offers **incredible performance, flexibility and freedom**.

It is a modern framework that will **help** you and **not restrict and limit** you.

It is a field-proven framework that has been developed for 12 years and practically used in various kinds of online applications and has recently been fully adapted to PHP8.

Framework places great emphasis not only on security and speed, but also on flexibility and adaptability.

PHP Jet is not only a library of classes, but includes **integrated development tools** such as **Jet Profiler** and **Jet Studio**, which **make work incredibly efficient and easy**.

This framework is developed for applications operated in the **European Union**. For this reason, it places great emphasis on the development of **localizable and cross-border applications**.

This is **not a new** experimental project, but a practically used and **mature framework** that leverages more than twenty years of experience with the development of online applications of the author of this framework.
